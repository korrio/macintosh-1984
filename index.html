                    On January 24, 1984, Apple Computer Inc. introduced the Macintosh, a revolutionary personal computer that would forever change the way people interact with technology. With its groundbreaking graphical user interface and mouse-driven navigation, the Macintosh represented a dramatic departure from the command-line interfaces that dominated personal computing at the time.

                    Two days before the Macintosh launch, Apple aired what would become one of the most famous commercials in television history during Super Bowl XVIII. Directed by Ridley Scott, the "1984" commercial depicted a dystopian world being shattered by the arrival of the Macintosh, positioning Apple as the liberator from IBM's dominance in personal computing.

                    The original Macintosh 128K featured a Motorola 68000 processor running at 8 MHz, 128 KB of RAM, and a built-in 9-inch black-and-white CRT display with a resolution of 512×342 pixels. What truly set it apart was not just its technical specifications, but its revolutionary operating system that introduced concepts like overlapping windows, a desktop metaphor, and point-and-click navigation.

                    The Macintosh project was led by a dedicated team of engineers, designers, and visionaries at Apple Computer Inc. Key figures included Jef Raskin, who conceived the original idea for an affordable, easy-to-use computer, and later Steve Jobs, who took over the project and pushed for a more sophisticated machine. The team worked tirelessly to create not just a computer, but an entirely new way of computing.
