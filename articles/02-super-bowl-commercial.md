**Two days before the Macintosh launch, Apple aired what would become one of the most famous commercials in television history during Super Bowl XVIII.** Directed by Ridley Scott, the "1984" commercial depicted a dystopian world being shattered by the arrival of the Macintosh, positioning Apple as the liberator from IBM's dominance in personal computing.

## The Creative Vision

The commercial was inspired by George Orwell's novel "1984" and featured a dystopian setting where gray-clad workers watched a Big Brother-like figure on enormous screens. A young woman athlete, representing the Macintosh, runs through the scene and hurls a sledgehammer at the screen, shattering the oppressive imagery.

The final message appeared on screen: "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984'."

## Behind the Scenes

The commercial was created by the Chiat/Day advertising agency and directed by Ridley Scott, who had recently completed "Blade Runner." The production took place in England and featured hundreds of extras, elaborate sets, and cinematic production values rarely seen in television advertising at the time.

The cost of production was approximately $900,000, with an additional $500,000 paid for the Super Bowl airtime—a significant investment that many at Apple questioned until they saw the results.

## The Controversy

Interestingly, the commercial faced internal resistance at Apple. The board of directors was reportedly horrified by the ad and wanted to fire the advertising agency. Only the intervention of Steve Jobs and the enthusiasm of early test audiences saved the campaign.

## Impact and Legacy

The "1984" commercial aired only twice on television—once during the Super Bowl and once during the late-night hours for award eligibility—yet it generated enormous buzz and media coverage. It's widely credited with launching the concept of the Super Bowl commercial as a cultural event in itself.

The advertisement won numerous awards, including the prestigious Clio Award and a Cannes Gold Lion. It was named the greatest commercial of all time by Advertising Age magazine and continues to be studied in marketing courses around the world.

More importantly, it perfectly captured Apple's brand positioning as the innovative challenger to established technology giants, a theme that would define the company's marketing for decades to come.
